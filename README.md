# EBook-Store-Bitcoin

This is an EBook store which accepts bitcoin for payments automatically. It is completely self-hosted and does not require any external api for payment processing. It requires you to set up a bitcoin node (bitcoind) locally.

Frontend is made using Svelte and backend is implemented in nodejs. It also generates QR code so customer can easily scan the QR in their bitcoin wallet and pay.
